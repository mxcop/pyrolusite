This was a bit of a challenge in the beginning because I had never really done embedded programming before. So A lot of the concepts and terms were a bit of a mystery.<p>However after the first week of doing a lot of research I learned a lot. And I was able to get CAN and some LEDs working. CAN <em>(Controller Area Network)</em> is used in most vehicles, it allows seperate modules to communicate with one another. While only requiring two wires, CAN High and CAN Low.<p>After the first two weeks of experimenting and researching, I started work on my 2 week assigment. Making a HAL <em>(Hardware Abstraction Layer)</em> for the new chips that we've received from NXP. The chip in question is the LPC54628, it's rocking a single core ARM Cortex processor. With a powerful set of peripherals, including of course CAN.<p>The HAL was to include:<ul><li><code>ADC</code> <em>(Analog to Digital)</em><li><code>CAN</code> <em>(Controller Area Network)</em><li><code>GPIO</code> <em>(General Purpose IO)</em><li><code>PWM</code> <em>(Pulse Width Modulation)</em><li><code>RIT</code> <em>(Repetitive Interrupt Timer)</em><li><code>SPI</code> <em>(Serial Peripheral Interface)</em><li><code>WDT</code> <em>(Watchdog Timer)</em></ul><p>I managed to implement all of them, however some more thoroughly then others. Primarly due to the limited time I had. <em>(Nevertheless I'm still very happy with the result)</em><p><em>Pictures of the LPC54628 Devboard & Can Transceiver</em> <h3>Week <code>5</code> (Feb 27 - Mar 05)</h3><p>During this week I worked on the Framework which is at the core of the car. It's the brain of the car, and also where the autonomous driving happens. We're trying to get rid of some unnecessary parts to reduce weight and complexity.<p>I got too work a little more together with Erik which was fun. Working together with others makes time pass a lot more quickly and feels more rewarding to me. I hope that when I'm done with my internship I'll have left behind something useful for everyone at URE.<h3>Week <code>6</code> (Mar 06 - Mar 12)</h3><p>This week I've started the monsterous task of migrating the ECU logic from Simulink to C++. Simulink is a way to write logic/code using blocks and connections between those blocks. The problem is that Simulink is a bit of a mess, and difficult to oversee / maintain. It's also less efficient then using C++ because Simulink has to make everything generic.<p>The ECU is the core/brain of the car, as I explained in my previous report. However in previous years the car has had <strong>two</strong> ECUs which intercommunicate using CAN. This means more weight and more complexity, however with this migration we will be able to merge them. Which will save roughly 2.5Kg of weight, and hopefully, make the code easier to maintain.<h3>Week <code>7</code> (Mar 13 - Mar 19)</h3><p>This week is rather uneventful, I've continued my work migrating the ECU logic. One fun thing that did happen was I did some research into RFID tags. So we can build one of these into the monocoque, containing a URL to the URE website.<p>RFID stands for Radio Frequency ID, it's usually a blue plastic droplet which contains a coil and a chip. Once a reader <em>(like your phone)</em> comes close enough to the tag, the tag wirelessly receives power through the coil. When powered up the tag will start transmitting it's contents immidiately. That's how these tags can function without requiring their own battery.<h3>Week <code>8</code> (Mar 20 - Mar 26)</h3><p>This week I managed to finish the task of rewriting the ESC (Electronic Systems Controller). I also participated in a sponsor event, where the board gave a presentation for our sponsors. It was very nice to see a more macro overview of the car and progress so far.<p>Afterall when you're working on just some software bits you don't really get a good overview of the whole car. Besides that this weekend we received the satellites and they passed our tests! *The satellites are PCBs that are placed ontop of the battery cells to monitor their voltage & temperature.* This is great news because without satellites the car won't be able to drive.<h3>Week <code>9</code> (Mar 27 - Apr 02)</h3><p>...</article><footer>© 2023 Max, All rights reserved.</footer></main>
